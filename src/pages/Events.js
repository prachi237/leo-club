      <br/>In the recent plantation drive at NIT Rourkela by Leo Club of Rourkela in collaboration with Youth For Sustainability we planted 10 varieties of plants with unique properties to make our campus greener. We planted a total of 100 plants in different parts of the campus.
      We're thankful to all the students who participated in the plantation drive and made it successful. It would not have been possible without the help of the cooperation of NIT Rourkela authority as well.

        "Do your Little Bit of Good where you are; it is those little bits of Good put all together that overwhelm the world."
This is mainly because environmental degradation threatens the existence of mankind.There can be a way in which every person can care for the environment.

So keeping in mind how to respect and nurture our environment, Leo Club of Rourkela is organising an online webinar on 12.07.2020(Sunday) at 7pm.
